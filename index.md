The Data Analytics and Science Hub (DASH) brings together existing 
Defra Group data science expertise, data science experience, and policymakers, 
delivery and leadership.

DASH aims to provide support and training for data scientists across Defra Group, 
function as a demonstrator for data science approaches, and develop community and 
capability across the Defra Group.

The Data Analytics and Science Hub (DASH) Platform enables the Defra Group to 
deliver more value from its data, enabling analysis and modelling to answer some 
key policy questions. It will store and manage the critical data needed for analysis 
centrally, provide governed access and offer an evolving set of tools and applications 
to analysts, scientists, data scientists and policy makers; giving them everything 
they need to access, process, analyse and visualise data.

The DASH team is based in the Central Analysis and Insights Division (CAID) in 
Defra and consists of a blended team working in collaboration with a wide range 
of directorates and arms lengths bodies.
