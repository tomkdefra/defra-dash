# Geospatial Science Learning Pathway

## Overview

The Geospatial Science Pathway is a structured learning journey designed for GIS professionals who are looking to transition their workflows from GUI-based software to Python programming.

1. **Fundamentals of GIS with Python**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Overview of GIS, including spatial data types, map projections, and basic GIS operations using Python libraries.

2. **Spatial Data Collection with Python**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Methods for collecting spatial data, including GPS and remote sensing, and integrating them into Python workflows.

3. **Geospatial Data Management with Python**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Techniques for managing and organising geospatial data using Python libraries such as GeoPandas.

4. **Spatial Analysis with Python**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Performing spatial analysis using Python, including spatial queries, overlay analysis, and network analysis.

5. **Cartography and Map Design with Python**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Principles of effective map design and creating maps using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Folium.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the Python Pathway in the Geospatial Science Learning Journey, participants will:
- Understand the core principles of geospatial science and GIS technology.
- Be skilled in collecting, managing, and analysing spatial data using Python.
- Be capable of performing advanced geospatial analyses and creating effective geospatial visualisations.
