# Data Science and Statistics Learning Pathway

## Overview

The Data Science and Statistics Learning Journey offers a structured pathway to develop skills in data analysis, statistical methods, and data science techniques. This journey is split into two paths: R and Python, each catering to beginner and intermediate learners. This guide outlines the pros and cons of each path and details the courses available.

## Learning Pathway

### R Pathway

#### Pros:
- Strong statistical analysis capabilities.
- Extensive library of packages for data manipulation and visualisation.
- Preferred in academia and research.

#### Cons:
- Steeper learning curve for those without a programming background.
- Less versatile for general-purpose programming compared to Python.

#### Beginner Level

1. **Introduction to Data Science with R**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Basics of data science, key concepts, and an introduction to R.

2. **Fundamentals of Statistics with R**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Introduction to statistical concepts and their implementation in R.

3. **Data Wrangling with R**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Techniques for cleaning and transforming data using R packages like dplyr and tidyr.

#### Intermediate Level

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Methods for exploring and visualising data to uncover patterns using R.

5. **Statistical Modelling with R**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Building and interpreting statistical models, including linear and logistic regression in R.

6. **Advanced Data Visualisation with R**
   - **Duration:** 
   - **Description:** Creating complex and interactive visualisations using ggplot2.

### Python Pathway

#### Pros:
