# Data Science and Statistics Learning Pathway

## Overview

The Data Science and Statistics Learning Journey offers a structured pathway to develop skills in data analysis, statistical methods, and data science techniques. This journey is split into two paths: R and Python, each catering to beginner and intermediate learners. This guide outlines the pros and cons of each path and details the courses available.

## R Pathway

#### Pros:
- Strong statistical analysis capabilities.
- Commonly taught in academia and research.

#### Cons:
- Poorly suited to building operational pipelines.
- Less versatile for general-purpose programming compared to Python.

## Python Pathway

#### Pros:
- Versatile and widely used.
- Extensive libraries for machine learning and data analysis.
- Easier to learn for beginners with a programming background.
- Ideal for developing operational pipelines and applications.

#### Cons:
- Less specialised for statistical analysis compared to R.
