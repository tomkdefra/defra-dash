# DASH Platform Training

_“I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."_

Linus Torvalds

Most introductions to git begin by describing what it is and how it came about: 
git is a version control system which grew out of the challenges of organising 
thousands of contributions made by individual developers working on the Linux 
kernel in the early 2000s. But that has been done much better by other people 
so instead, I’ll try to describe what git isn’t with reference to some commonly 
used tools which you might at first think are similar.
