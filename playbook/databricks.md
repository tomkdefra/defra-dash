# Databricks

## Use case

Databricks is a cloud-based Data Engineering tool which allows for
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, data analytics and machine
learning.  

Databricks is built on Apache spark, which is an open-source,
distributed processing system used for big data. It optimizes query
execution on large datasets, drastically reducing execution times by
splitting the execution across multiple parallel processers. Since
Python and R are single threaded i.e., they are designed to operate on a
conventional processer, code may require amending to make most efficient
use of the parallel processing available through Apache Spark. Apache
Spark provides APIs for many programming languages including Python & R,
allowing people to use Spark in an environment they feel comfortable
with.
